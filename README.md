# Machine Learning Models README

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files (`*.ipynb`) to train and test various machine learning models on the dataset `41-50.csv`. The following machine learning tasks are implemented:

1. Boosting with Adaboost
2. Classification with a neural network
3. Clustering
4. Data Extraction
5. Feature Extraction
6. Missing Value Imputation
7. Random Forests
8. Regression
9. Shallow Neural Networks

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing these machine learning models is `41-50.csv`. It contains the necessary features and labels required for the respective tasks.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into separate Jupyter Notebook files for each machine learning task. Here's a brief overview of each notebook:

1. `adaboost_boosting.ipynb`: Contains the implementation of boosting with Adaboost.
2. `neural_network_classification.ipynb`: Implements classification using a neural network.
3. `clustering.ipynb`: Implements clustering algorithms.
4. `data_extraction.ipynb`: Handles data extraction techniques.
5. `feature_extraction.ipynb`: Contains feature extraction methods.
6. `missing_value_imputation.ipynb`: Implements techniques for handling missing values.
7. `random_forests.ipynb`: Implements random forest classifiers.
8. `regression.ipynb`: Implements regression techniques.
9. `shallow_neural_networks.ipynb`: Contains the implementation of shallow neural networks.

## Running the Notebooks

To run any specific machine learning task, open the corresponding Jupyter Notebook file using Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VS Code with the Python extension installed. Ensure that you have the necessary Python dependencies installed. You can install the dependencies using `pip` with the provided `requirements.txt` file.

Open VS Code and navigate to the desired notebook. You can then execute the cells to run the code.

## Results
Each notebook generates results based on the trained models and the evaluation metrics used for each task. The results are typically displayed within the notebook itself or saved to a file for further analysis.
